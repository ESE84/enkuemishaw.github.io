								<h3 class="major">Hello, Welcome to my page!</h3>

	<p> I am an engineer by trade and an optimist at heart, looking to tackle today’s pressing human and business challenges by leveraging my principle-based and data driven problem solving skills. I studied Chemical Engineering in Toronto, Ontario, and have had the opportunity to work in six different industries as a student, consultant, and employee. From Syncrude’s oil upgrader site in Fort McMurray to Capital One Financial in Toronto, I have added value to businesses by identifying key operational problems and forwarding effective and economical solutions both individually and as part of a team. I am currently in the Ivey MBA program to become a well-rounded leader with hopes to spearhead and accelerate the journey to a sustainable world.
		Visit the <a href="#Testimonials">‘Testimonials’ tab</a> of this webpage for comments from past clients and coworkers I have had the pleasure to work with.
</p>
								<h3 class="major">What’s next?</h3>
								<li>I am thrilled to be joining the 100th cohort of the Ivey program to complete my MBA degree and become a well rounded leader.</li>
								<li>I will share opinions on strategies the developing world, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, could follow to limit the negative impacts of climate change and achieve the 17 sustainable development goals outlined by the UN.</li>

								<p><h3 class="major">Flying</h3> </p>
								<p>For as far back as I can remember I have always been facinated with airplanes. I decided to take up flying during the 2020 lockdown and had my first flight (with an instructor) the summer of 2021. Its been an exciting journey!</p>

								<p><h3 class="major">Soccer Coach </h3></p> 
								
								<p>I played soccer in middle school and in high school, with some success in the later years as a key member of a team that made it to the Toronto city finals. Inspired by my nephews’ interest in the game and their hunger for guidance, I volunteered to coach a mixed gender U-12 soccer team from 2016 - 2018. 
Pictured below is the team that reached the semi-finals of the 2016 tournament. Go team ‘Portugal’!

									 <p><h3 class="major">Could religion help with the green revolution?</h3> </p>
										<p> 	<h6>  August,2021    </h6> </p>
									
									
									<p> The inspiration to start a green club out of the St. THEO church volunteer group stemmed from a documentary I watched on one of the oldest and most sacred monastery in the world, the Waldiba monastery. 
									Located in the North Western region of Ethiopia, Waldiba is stated to have been built in 490 AD and has been reliably producing many church scholars and teachers throughout its 1500 years of service. 
									The remote location of the site combined with low overall access to electricity in the country has left residents of this historical monastery to rely on burning wood and charcoal to meet their day to day energy needs. <br><br>
									
									Wood burning releases CO2 into the atmosphere and is one of the main air pollutants in developing nations.  
									Theoretically, the released CO2 can be offset by planting an equivalent number of trees but according to the UN the proportion of landmass covered by forests in Ethiopia has dropped from over 40% in the 20th century to close to 2.3% in the year 2000. 
									According to Global Forrest Watch, the country has lost 18.0kha of tree cover between 2010 and 2020, which is equivalent to approximately 8.74Mt in CO2 emissions. 
									While wood burning is not the only or main reason for the alarming decline in forest density in the country, the carbon dioxide pollution from wood burning is highest in countries where harvesting of wood for fires is least sustainable. 
									Large scale reforestation campaigns along with the implementation of sustainable wood harvesting practises will help balance emitted pollutants but this takes a significant amount of time and does not address the reliance on wood burning as an energy source. 
									This challenge has proven to be difficult to solve since it impacts millions of people predominantly settled sparsely across the country side with limited access to critical infrastructure. <br> <i>(Large scale projects could have multiplier effect, understanding that, the St THEO club has advocated for the GERD hydroelectric dam and mobilized the community to support the project through fund raising)</i>. <br><br>
									The reliance on wood burning is common in developing nations where there is less organizational and social infrastructures. Entrepreneurs, governments and non-profit organization working on tackling this issue may benefit from understanding the important role religion plays in the day to day lives of many communities in the horn of Africa. 
									Developing religious institution centric frameworks could be instrumental in the green transition in the developing world for easier integration and widespread acceptance in those communities. <br><br>
											
									The St. THEO club’s mission is to raise awareness of climate change and its consequences and mobilize the community to act on initiatives we believe will help lower carbon footprint from energy sources. The club has so far delivered on this mission by installing 110 new LED lights and an automated thermostat at the site of the St. THEO church in Toronto Ontario.

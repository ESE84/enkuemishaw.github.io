								<h3 class="major">Hello, Welcome to my page!</h3>
<p> I am an Engineer by trade and an optimist at heart in the fight against climate change looking to accelerate the journey to a sustainable world. Although I was interested in sustainability in University on internship in Alberta, Canada, it was not clear to me how I can personally contribute (beyond diligently recycling and investing in ‘ESG’ ETFs) until I read the book Natural Capitalism by Paul Hawken and Amory Lovins. </p>
								<p>The book briefly illustrated not only the scale and magnitude of the problem but the measures that need to be taken, as well as the opportunities available within the current economic structure that future companies and businesses need to take advantage in order to curb or limit the negative impacts of climate change.</p> 

	<p> I studied Chemical Engineering in Toronto, Ontario where I currently live and have had the opportunity to work in 6 different industries as a student, consultant and employee. From Syncrude’s oil upgrader site in Fort McMurray to Capital One in Toronto, I have added value by identifying key operational problems and forwarding economical and effective solutions both individually and as part of a team. Operational optimization by analyzing real time data has been the core of my work to enhance and maintain efficient and robust operations.  Visit the <a href="#Testimonials">‘Testimonies’ tab</a> of this webpage for comments from past clients and coworkers I have had the pleasure to work with.  
</a></p>
								<h3 class="major">What’s next?</h3>
<p> I will be joining the Venture Capital world focused on sustainability with the expectations to work and support with companies engaged on a similar mission.  Portfolio companies can expect relentless pursuit of operational simplicity, focus on increasing capabilities and a principle-based effort to create an autonomous, automated, and controlled operation. 
I will publish opinions on strategies the developing world could follow to limit the impacts of climate change and join the developed world on the road to sustainability.  </p>

								<p>For as far back as I can remember I have always been facinated with airplanes. I decided to take up on flying as my newest adventure during the 2020 lockdown and had my first flight (with an instructor) the summer of 2021. Exciting Journey!</p>

								<p>I played soccer in Middle School and High School where we made it to the Toronto city finals in 2010. Inspired by my newphews interest in the game I took the oppurtunity to give back to the game and coached a mixed gender U-12 soccer team from 2016 - 2018 in Scarbrough, Ontario.  </p>
